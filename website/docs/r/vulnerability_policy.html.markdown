    Creates vulnerability policies in Dome9

# dome9_vulnerability_policy

This resource is used to create and modify the Workload Vulnerability policy in CloudGuard. A Workload Vulnerability policy is the combination of a Ruleset applied to a specific cloud environment with a specific action.
When defining a Workload Vulnerability on a Kubernetes environment, you can define the admission control actions on unscanned and incompliant images action to ‘detect’ or ‘protect’

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```hcl
resource "dome9_vulnerability_policy" "test_vlm_policy" {
  target_id    = "Environment ID"
  ruleset_id   = 00000
  target_type  = "Kubernetes"
  notification_ids    = ["NOTIFICATION IDS"]
  admission_control_action       = "Detection"
  admission_control_unscanned_action       = "Detection"
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

-   `target_id` - (Required) The kubernetes environment id / organizational unit id.
-   `ruleset_id` - (Required) The bundle id for the bundle that will be used in the policy.
-   `target_type` - (Required) Vendor type (`Aws`, `Azure`, `ContainerRegistry`, `Gcp`, `Kubernetes`,  `ShiftLeft`, `OrganizationalUnit`).
-   `notification_ids` - (Required) The notification policy id's for the policy [list].
-   `admission_control_action` - (Optional) Admission Policy action ("Prevention", "Detection").
-   `admission_control_unscanned_action` - (Optional) Admission Policy action ("Prevention", "Detection").

## Attributes Reference

-   `id` - Id of the vulnerability policy.

## Import

The policy can be imported; use `<POLICY ID>` as the import ID.

For example:

```shell
terraform import dome9_vulnerability_policy.test 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```
